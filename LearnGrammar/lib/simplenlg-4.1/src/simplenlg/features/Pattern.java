 * An enumeration representing the different types of morphology patterns used

 * is a way of informing the morphology processor which set of rules should be
 * used when inflecting the word.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The pattern is recorded in the {@code Feature.PATTERN} feature and applies to
 * adjectives, nouns and verbs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that the morphology processor will use user-defined
 * inflections or those found in a lexicon first before applying the supplied
 * rules.
