/**
 * <p>
 * <code>NLGModule</code> is the base class that all processing modules extend
 * from. This is abstract and cannot therefore be instantiated itself. The
 * supplied processing modules that come pre-packaged in SimpleNLG can be found
 * within their appropriate packages.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All processing modules perform realisation on a tree of
 * <code>NLGElement</code>s. The modules can alter the tree in whichever way
 * they wish. For example, the syntax processor replaces phrase elements with
 * list elements consisting of inflected words while the morphology processor
 * replaces inflected words with string elements.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>N.B.</b> the use of <em>module</em>, <em>processing module</em> and
 * <em>processor</em> is interchangeable. They all mean an instance of this
 * class.
