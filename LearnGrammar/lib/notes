==CORPUS==

The carrots in the garden are my favourites.
(ncsubj are "The _carrots_ in the garden" _)

My best friend in the world likes to gossip.
ncsubj likes "My best friend in the world"

==TEST==

He likes oranges
>
My best friend in the world likes oranges

==IMPLEMENTATION==

1. Syntax:

$likes>ncsubj

2. in LearnGrammar:

DepStr heLikesOrangesDs;
DepStr friendLikesGossipDs;
GR ncsubjLikesHeGr;
GR ncsubjLikesFriendGr;

heLikesOrangesDs.substitute(ncsubjLikesHeGr, ncsubjLikesFriendGr)

3. In DS.substitute:

Save from.head.
Save indices (min and max) of tokens under 'from' GR (crash out for the moment if not contiguous!)
Make list of GRs and tokens ONLY referenced by subtree headed by 'from'. Remove all such tokens and GRs from DS.
Attach 'to' GR to from.head.
Find all tokens that sit underneath 'to'. (partially implemented: findDependencySubset)
Insert these tokens into the token list, starting at min index.
Fix indices by iterating over tokens and setting their indices to be their list positions.
