<title>SimpleNLG Features</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The features package contains enumerated types that are used for
specific features. A complete list of currently implemented features is
given in the abstract class {@code Feature}. Particular attention should
be paid to using the correct type with these features and, when
introducing new features, that existing feature names are not
overwritten.</p>
<p>Features are stored as a <code>Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</code>
on the <code>NLGElement</code>. The base way of accessing features is
through the <code>getFeature()</code> and <code>setFeature()</code>
methods. There are additional convenience methods for converting the
feature object to a particular type. In addition, classes extending from
<code>NLGElement</code> may have additional convenience methods for
accessing features.</p>
