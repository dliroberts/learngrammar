	/**
	 * <p>
	 * This method determines if the supplied elementCategory forms an immediate
	 * sub-part of <code>this</code> category. The allowed sub-parts for each
	 * <code>this</code> type are outlined below:
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b>DOCUMENT</b>: can contain SECTIONs, PARAGRAPHs, SENTENCEs and
	 * LISTs. It cannot contain other DOCUMENTs or LIST_ITEMs.</li>
	 * <li><b>SECTION</b>: can contain SECTIONs (referred to as subsections),
	 * PARAGRAPHs, SENTENCEs and LISTs. It cannot contain DOCUMENTs or
	 * LIST_ITEMs.</li>
	 * <li><b>PARAGRAPH</b>: can contain SENTENCEs or LISTs. It cannot contain
	 * DOCUMENTs, SECTIONs, other PARAGRAPHs or LIST_ITEMs.</li>
	 * <li><b>SENTENCE</b>: can only contain other forms of
	 * <code>NLGElement</code>s. It cannot contain DOCUMENTs, SECTIONs,
	 * PARAGRAPHs, other SENTENCEs, LISTs or LIST_ITEMs.</li>
	 * <li><b>LIST</b>: can only contain LIST_ITEMs. It cannot contain
	 * DOCUMENTs, SECTIONs, PARAGRAPHs, SENTENCEs or other LISTs.</li>
	 * <li><b>LIST_ITEMs</b>: can contain PARAGRAPHs, SENTENCEs, LISTs or other
	 * forms of <code>NLGElement</code>s. It cannot contain DOCUMENTs, SECTIONs,
	 * or LIST_ITEMs.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * For structuring text, this effectively becomes the test for relevant
	 * child types affecting the immediate children. For instance, it is
	 * possible for a DOCUMENT to contains LIST_ITEMs but only if the LIST_ITEMs
	 * are children of LISTs.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * A more precise definition of SENTENCE would be that it only contains
	 * PHRASEs. However, this DocumentCategory does not consider these options
	 * as this crosses the boundary between orthographic structure and syntactic
	 * structure.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * In pseudo-BNF this can be written as:
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 *    DOCUMENT 		 ::= DOCUMENT_PART*
	 *    DOCUMENT_PART  ::= SECTION | PARAGRAPH
	 *    SECTION 		 ::= DOCUMENT_PART*
	 *    PARAGRAPH 	 ::= PARAPGRAPH_PART*
	 *    PARAGRAPH_PART ::= SENTENCE | LIST
	 *    SENTENCE 	 	 ::= &lt;NLGElement&gt;*
	 *    LIST 			 ::= LIST_ITEM*
	 *    LIST_ITEM 	 ::= PARAGRAPH | PARAGRAPH_PART | &lt;NLGElement&gt;
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * Ideally the '*' should be replaced with '+' to represent that one or more
	 * of the components must exist rather than 0 or more. However, the
	 * implementation permits creation of the <code>DocumentElement</code>s with
	 * no children or sub-parts added.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param elementCategory
	 *            the category we are checking against. If this is
	 *            <code>NULL</code> the method will return <code>false</code>.
	 * @return <code>true</code> if the supplied elementCategory is a sub-part
	 *         of <code>this</code> type of category, <code>false</code>
	 *         otherwise.
