/**
 * <p>
 * This class defines a adverbial phrase.  It is essentially
 * a wrapper around the <code>PhraseElement</code> class, with methods
 * for setting common constituents such as preModifier.
 * For example, the <code>setAdverb</code> method in this class sets
 * the head of the element to be the specified adverb
 *
 * From an API perspective, this class is a simplified version of the AdvPhraseSpec
 * class in simplenlg V3.  It provides an alternative way for creating syntactic
 * structures, compared to directly manipulating a V4 <code>PhraseElement</code>.
 * 
 * Methods are provided for setting and getting the following constituents:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>PreModifier		(eg, "very")
 * <LI>Adverb        (eg, "quickly")
 * </UL>
 * 
 * NOTE: AdvPhraseSpec do not usually have (user-set) features
 * 
 * <code>AdvPhraseSpec</code> are produced by the <code>createAdverbPhrase</code>
 * method of a <code>PhraseFactory</code>
